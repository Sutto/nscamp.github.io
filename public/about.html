          <h1>About the camp</h1>

<p>A bunch of iOS developers had a couple of drinks in may and as a result we came up with NSCamp.
We want to organise an Apple developer weekend under the motto of...</p>

<p>&quot;Social weekend meets hacking with like minded developers&quot;</p>

<p>It looks like there is quite a bit of interest in a developer weekend and the people we talked to were pretty excited about it. So, we decided to put our hands up to organise the first NSCamp.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s going to happen there?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can code/hack</li>
<li>Maybe you&#39;ve been wanting to extract some code out into a library</li>
<li>Work on some bugs fixes to a library you use</li>
<li>Progress your side project</li>
<li>Chill out and play with new stuff (e.g. iOS 7)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Or</strong> maybe you just want to make some new friends in the iOS/OSX community.
Most importantly the atmosphere is social and supportive. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be a great coder to go</p>

<h2>Where</h2>

<p>It&#39;s going to be in the country side approximately 1hr away form Melbourne. 
We haven&#39;t yet decided where, but if you&#39;re interested you should <a href="%22/register.html%22">register</a> your interest.</p>

<p>We plan to hire a basic camp with simple accommodation and space to pitch a tent (if you want to have it more quite).
 We try to get some catering organised and some social beverages.  </p>

<p>Basically it is what <a href="%22http://railscamp.com%22">railscamp</a> is for the ruby community.</p>

<p><code>NSCamp *camp = [[RailsCamp railsCamp] copy];</code></p>

<p>So when it is going to happen and how many can attend? </p>
