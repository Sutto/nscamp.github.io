How much will the camp cost?
============================

We're still in the early stages of organising the camp, so we don't really know how much exactly.
**However** a ticket to Railscamp *(which is the inspiration for NSCamp)* costs **around $240**, so you
can expect NSCamp to cost about the same. 

Please don't hold us to the price, as this may change. We believe the ticket price for each railscamp
changes depending on where it's located. As some camping spots are more expensive to hire and to get to.
