<h1>About NSCamp</h1>


If you've been to railscamp, or at least heard waht it's a about, then you already know what NSCamp is about.


A weekend away with likeminded iOS and OSX developers. 
The aims for the weekend

* Meet new and interesting people
* Hack on your side project
* Contribute that bug fix to that library you've been using

Coding is obviously encouraged, but you don't have to code all weekend. 
That would probably feel too much like work.

NScamp will ultimately be about the awesome people that you meet, and extending the iOS/OSX developer community
