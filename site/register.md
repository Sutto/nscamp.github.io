Register for the camp
=====================

We want to keep the first NSCamp small, just to reduce the amount of organising involved
as we're going to be figuring this out as we go along. 

So we're limiting registration to 30-50 people at the moment. 
This is a soft limit, as we're also trying to gauge interest from the community.

To register your interest, fill in [this google form](https://docs.google.com/a/jtribe.com.au/forms/d/1qD8BeHvkuJ2388uEOg2Gpqm6pQ6Fs5JnIE74oEDItcw/viewform).

Let us know what you think about NSCamp and if you want to be involved in organising it.
